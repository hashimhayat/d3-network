         "synop": "<p>Weaving around a theory of immortality based on the premise that our lives are a summation of all the information we consume and process, gleaned from existing theories from a number of scientific disciplines, the film draws on my personal history&rsquo;s brush with a global nuclear disaster, to precipitate a meditation on the potential role of an individual in the imaginary film/event of our individual or collective death: as a protagonist, or as an extra appearing in a handful of frames at the very moment of their death. The (im)possibility of a singular setting for such an event is at question, and there is a temporal flattening accompanying the spacial flattening, both as a collapse of history implied by the end of potential futures, but also the flattening of time implicit in our fascination with ruin. The uncanny familiarity we gain with spaces through mainstream cinema, which is itself becoming increasingly domesticated, is not unlike what is made possible with streetview. By releasing locations such as the pyramids and the Taj Mahal, themselves monumental attempts at immortality, streetview is declaring itself as a competitor to tourism, tourism itself a chase of experience and self-documentation. The virtual experience may not quite compare to the real thing yet, but the mediated virtual experience carries the same indexical value as the mediated real thing, being one step removed from the physical world. The question of authenticity in terms of cinematic authorship as well as consumption remains to be answered. If you could experience everything that ever was, would you still be afraid?&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n",

As an Artist in Residence at Pier 9, Amy collaborated with Autodesk to create &ldquo;Regenerative Reliquary,&rdquo; a sculpture consisting of 3D printed scaffolds for cell growth in a bioreactor. The intention is that stem cells seeded onto these scaffolds will grow into bone. She hopes that this project serves as a foundation for further exploration and opens conversations about the awe and mystery of life, transhumanism, synthetic biology, the future of medicine and implants, and things that could be made from the building blocks of life.

Five centuries later, cancer surgeon Casper van Eijck arrives at the same conclusion: &ldquo;You get cancer because you&rsquo;re alive.&rdquo; This film follows Van Eijck as he goes about his daily tasks at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam. We also meet a cell biologist, a night nurse, a pediatric oncologist and a pathologist. Examining a culture of rapidly multiplying cancer cells, the biologist sighs, &ldquo;That you can reveal so much, but know so little about what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo; We owe progress in medical science exclusively to unremitting human curiosity and attentiveness; the fundamentals have changed little since Hippocrates. Then as now, doctors relied on human techniques of looking, feeling and cutting. We also see patients and parents of sick children respond bravely to the devastating news doctors so often have to give. Perhaps mice will provide the answer to the question of why cells divide uncontrollably, because this animal shares 80% of its genes with humans.<\/p>\r\n",

Anatomy claims to be the place &ldquo;where death is pleased to help the living.&quot; This inscription at the entrance of many anatomical institutes explains the special relationship between the anatomist and the physical body. Here, the corpses of voluntary donors get dissected into their smallest units. Talking to an anatomist, her employees and body donors, &lsquo;Spirit of a Dissection&rsquo; enrolls very personal thoughts about death and the human existence. It soon gets clear that, despite a professional distance to the corpse, the story of the body donor will always be present.<\/p>\r\n",
